# DatabaseProject1

Created a relational database as seen in shruti_p1.sql using SQL commands to create tables and all other structures. For each table in the database, I specified primary key and indicated all reasonable foreign key constraints, if any. I populated sufficient data into the database and queried the database as seen in log.txt.
